     <h2> Good question!, here are some banana facts (if you want the answer go to the about page)</h2>

     
   <ul>
    <li>The banana fruit got its name after being sold wrapped in aluminum foil for 10 cents at the 1876 Philadelphia World Fair.</li>
    <li>The classic banana species we consumed was called the Gros Michel. It was sweeter and creamier than the modern banana. However, due to a devastating disease in 1965, farmers switched to the current variety, the Cavendish.</li>
     <ul>
      <li>There are over 1000 different varieties of bananas worldwide, divided into 50 groups. The most common and widely exported type is the Cavendish banana.</li>
     </ul>
    <li>Bananas are scientifically classified as berries, while strawberries are not. A berry must contain seeds inside the flesh, not outside.</li>
    <li>Eating bananas may lower the risk of stroke and heart attack due to their potassium content. They help prevent stiffness in the aorta and hardening of the arteries.</li>
    <li>You share 50 percent of your DNA with each of your parents. But with bananas, we share about 50 percent of our genes, which turns out to be only about 1 percent of our DNA</li>
   </ul>
